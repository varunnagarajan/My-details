## Guidelines to build your Angular app ##

- Source files are stored in `/src`
- Test related files are in `/test`
- All top-level features should be put in separate folders. In this template,
`home`, `common` and `dashboard` are the three feature folders.
- `common` is a special feature folder to store app-level files, eg: common directives, services, filters, etc.
- Each feature folder should have its own templates (*.html), scripts and styles (*.scss)
- All of the styles are combined in `src/app.scss`
- All scripts are included in `index.html`
